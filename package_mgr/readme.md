This is a basic implementation of the requested Rust GUI application using egui for the interface and SQLite for data persistence. It focuses on a single local host (detected automatically as Fedora or Ubuntu). Key features:
•  Snapshot Creation: Click “Create Snapshot” to capture the current installed packages and save them to the database.
•  Snapshot Listing: Displays snapshots in a table with right-click support for context menus.
•  Restore: Right-click a snapshot and confirm “Restore to this snapshot?” to revert the system packages to that state (removes extras, installs missing/changed ones).
•  Differences: Select a snapshot, click “Compare with another snapshot”, choose another, and view collapsible tables showing added, removed, and changed packages.
•  Database: All data (hosts, snapshots, packages) is stored in packages.db in the current directory.
Notes/Limitations:
•  Package listing and restoration use simplified command parsing; real-world use may need refinement for edge cases (e.g., exact version pinning, dependencies).
•  Restoration runs dnf/apt-get synchronously and assumes sudo privileges aren’t needed (run the app with elevated perms if required).
•  Diff computation is basic (name-based, version strings compared directly).
•  Supports only local host; extending to remote hosts would require SSH integration.
•  To run: cargo run. Ensure you’re on Fedora/Ubuntu.
