This is a basic implementation of the requested Rust GUI application using egui for the interface and SQLite for data persistence. It focuses on a single local host (detected automatically as Fedora or Ubuntu). Key features:<BR>
<BR>
•  Snapshot Creation: Click “Create Snapshot” to capture the current installed packages and save them to the database.<BR>
•  Snapshot Listing: Displays snapshots in a table with right-click support for context menus.<BR>
•  Restore: Right-click a snapshot and confirm “Restore to this snapshot?” to revert the system packages to that state (removes extras, installs missing/changed ones).<BR>
•  Differences: Select a snapshot, click “Compare with another snapshot”, choose another, and view collapsible tables showing added, removed, and changed packages.<BR>
•  Database: All data (hosts, snapshots, packages) is stored in packages.db in the current directory.<BR><BR>
Notes/Limitations:<BR>
•  Package listing and restoration use simplified command parsing; real-world use may need refinement for edge cases (e.g., exact version pinning, dependencies).<BR>
•  Restoration runs dnf/apt-get synchronously and assumes sudo privileges aren’t needed (run the app with elevated perms if required).<BR>
•  Diff computation is basic (name-based, version strings compared directly).<BR>
•  Supports only local host; extending to remote hosts would require SSH integration.<BR>
•  To run: cargo run. Ensure you’re on Fedora/Ubuntu.<BR>
