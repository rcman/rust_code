This is a simplified clone of StarCraft implemented in Python using Pygame. It includes core features like:
•  Races: Basic Terran (human player) and Zerg (simple AI opponent).
•  Units: Workers (for gathering), Marines (Terran), Zerglings (Zerg). Units can move, attack, and harvest resources.
•  Buildings: Command Center/Hatchery (starting), Supply Depot (not fully implemented), Barracks (buildable for training Marines).
•  Resources: Minerals (gathering from patches; gas not fully implemented).
•  Supply System: Basic tracking (increases with training).
•  Selection and Commands: Box selection, move/harvest/attack orders via mouse.
•  AI: Simple behaviors like harvesting, training units, and attacking.
•  Map: Procedurally generated terrain with resource nodes.
•  Combat: Basic health/damage system.
To run it:
1.  Ensure Pygame is installed (pip install pygame).
2.  Save the code to a file (e.g., starcraft_clone.py).
3.  Run python starcraft_clone.py.
This is a prototype—full StarCraft has campaigns, multiplayer, more units/buildings, fog of war, etc. Expanding it would require more code, assets (sprites/sounds), and balancing. If you’d like additions (e.g., Protoss race, better AI, or specific features), let me know!
